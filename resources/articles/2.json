The term pizza was first recorded in the 10th century \nin a Latin manuscript from the Southern Italian town of Gaeta in Lazio, on the border with Campania. \nModern pizza was invented in Naples, and the dish and its variants have since become popular in many countries. \nIt has become one of the most popular foods in the world and a common fast food item in Europe and North America, \navailable at pizzerias (restaurants specializing in pizza), restaurants offering Mediterranean cuisine, \nand via pizza delivery. Many companies sell ready-baked frozen pizzas to be reheated in an ordinary home oven."}
