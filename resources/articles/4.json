Its origins can be traced to Townsville in far north Queensland,\n Australia, and to Broken Hill, New South Wales, Australia. It is a common and popular dish in\n Broken Hill restaurants and households. Cheese slaw is also consumed in some areas of the United States.\n Cheese slaw is prepared using grated cheese, crumbled or cubed cheese, grated carrot, and a mayonnaise\n dressing.
