Ciabatta is somewhat elongated, broad, and flat, and is baked in many variations, although \nunique for its alveolar holes. Ciabatta is made with a stronger flour and uses a very \nmuch wetter dough than traditional French bread. While panino indicates any kind of sandwich regardless of \nthe bread used (whether slices or a bun), a toasted sandwich made from small loaves of ciabatta is \nknown as panini (plural of panino) outside Italy.Ciabatta bread was first produced in \n1982 by Arnaldo Cavallari, who called the bread ciabatta polesana after Polesine, the area he \nlived in. The recipe was subsequently licensed by Cavallari's company, Molini Adriesi, to bakers in 11 countries by 1999. \nCavallari and other bakers in Italy were concerned by the popularity of sandwiches made from\n baguettes imported from France, which were endangering their businesses, and so set about \ntrying to create an Italian alternative with which to make sandwiches. The recipe for \nciabatta came about after several weeks of trying variations of traditional bread recipes and \nconsists of a soft, wet dough made with high gluten flour."}
